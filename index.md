<p>
  Welcome! My name is Davide Posillipo and this is my personal webpage. I'm based in Milan (Italy), where I work as freelancer data scientist. Lately I have been developing an increasing interest towards disciplines that are outside of data science: sometimes adjacent (design), sometimes orthogonal (critical studies). 
</p>

<p>
  During the past years I spent quite a lot of time teaching data science topics in different contexts, especially for professionals transitioning to data science from other fields. 
</p>

<p>
  I also enjoy music (I play the electric bass guitar, deep diving into jazz at the moment), poetry and literature. Occasionaly I try to develop my photographer skills too. 
</p>


<p> This space is organized with two main sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work Projects: current or recent work-related projects</li>
<li>Personal Interests: what I&#39;m currently bringing on as personal interests and projects</li>
<li>Blog: here I share reflections on what I am doing, what I am reading and what I am thinking about. Hopefully I&#39;ll be posting not too rarely! </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Feel free to contact me if you are curious to know more about what I am doing! I am also open to collaborations for short terms projects, teaching or mentoring activities. Below my contact details. Thanks for visiting my page!
