  Welcome! My name is Davide Posillipo and this is my personal webpage. I'm based in Milan (Italy), where I work as freelancer data scientist. Lately I have been developing an increasing interest towards disciplines that are outside of data science: sometimes adjacent (design), sometimes orthogonal (critical studies).

  Feel free to contact me if you are curious to know more about what I am doing! I am also open to collaborations for short terms projects, teaching or mentoring activities. Below my contact details. Thanks for visiting my page!
