As Deep Learning & Big Data Department, we showcased our RAG Virtual Assistant, Alia, during the event "Beyond Production" at Artissima, Torino 2023. 

Alia listened to the event talks and provided a summary of it, as well as "an opinion" about the topics involved. 

This was an example of the usage of LLMs to capture live events information and to retrieve it more easily than with non-AI methods. 

[Here](https://bp-symposium.it/en) the event details and results.
