As industrial partner of [BRIO](https://sites.unimi.it/brio/), I am working on topics such as bias and fairness in AI. During this event organized and promoted by Corriere della Sera, a major Italian newspaper, we will showcase the first results of our collaboration in terms of BRIOxAlkemy, a software capable of recognizing signs of biases in AI predictions. 

We will be presenting the tool on Friday 8th afternoon, Saturday 9th and Sunday 10th September, 2023. The location is the wonderfull Triennale in Milano, close to Parco Sempione. [Here](https://eventi.corriere.it/il-tempo-delle-donne-2023/evento/algoritmo-e-pregiudizio-2/) the details for the Saturday session.

Our intervention will happen within the 10th edition of Il Tempo delle Donne, a public event dedicated to equality, fairness and culture. [Here](https://27esimaora.corriere.it/il-tempo-delle-donne/) to learn more.
