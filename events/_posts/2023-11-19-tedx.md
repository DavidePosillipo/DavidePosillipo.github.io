Workshop on gender stereotypes and LLMs at TedXVenice. Our intention is to show that LLMs can do much better in terms of fairness if they are made aware of the issue and "asked" to take into account the possibility of being biased. 

As Deep Learning & Big Data Department, we developed and tested an approach based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to mitigate bias and stereotypes amplifications.
