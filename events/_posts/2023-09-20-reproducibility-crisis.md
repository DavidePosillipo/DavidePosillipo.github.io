I will be an invited speaker for the University of Padua Summer School on Replicability Crisis in Science ([here](https://replicability.stat.unipd.it) the summer school website). 

This summer school, proposed and organized by the Statistical Sciences Department of UniPD, will see professors and practictioners from different fields discussing about replicability and riproducibility issues in their domains, with the goal to reach a common ground on the main challenges and potential new research directions. 

The audience is a selected group of PhDs and post-docs from different disciplines and institutions. 

My talk will be focused on the issues of replicability that we encounter in the industry of applied data science, and how with my research department (Deep Learning & Big Data Department) we are trying to face these issues. I will post more in the following weeks on this topic.
