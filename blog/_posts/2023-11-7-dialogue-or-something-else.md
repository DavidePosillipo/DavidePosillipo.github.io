*On the ways Data Science and other fields could have a meaningful dialogue, and my mixed feelings about it.* 

Written without usage of LLMs. 

<br />


During the last two years at least, I spent quite a lot of time trying to understand the world of Data Science from the perspective of people and communities outside of the tech world. It has been a long journey that brought me to get in touch with philosophers, sociologists, designers, artists, content creators. My motivation was and still is to widen my understanding of what *data* means in different contexts, or better, to define what data *actually is* in the first place, given that it seems to be an empty concept unless it is embedded in a concrete situation. 

It is fun: during the course of 5 intense years of academic studies in Statistics, a proper, satisfying definition of data was never really provided. Data is a structure – a.k.a. data structures: tabular data, sequences, time series, tensors, and the like – but a structure for what? What does this structure contain? The answer, I understood after long time, cannot be offered by Statistics, or by Data Science more broadly. These are disciplines that help you in manipulating a digital footprint, a reflection of something coming from other realms: physical phenomena, societies, individual human acts. And these reflections are transformed through mathematical tools and offered back to their creators, usually hoping to improve something: an engineering system, an economic indicator, a life. 

Despite this “middle-layer” role and the constitutive emptiness of its object (or, maybe, thanks to this), Data Science has managed to reach a prominent role in our society and in our daily lives, and this shouldn’t be surprising if the image I proposed is not completely wrong: Data Science amplifies signals coming from every aspect of our world, as we experience it, and it’s sending back to us these signals. And this happens all the time: when we open a bank account, when we access a website, when we buy a medication. 

All these factors are central in my intention of meeting and understanding communities outside of Data Science. I approached this dialogue with optimism, very likely with a good dose of naivety, assuming that the other communities were looking into the same problem with the same attitude.  

From my experience, this dialogue is in fact often plagued by a factor: a strong, negative prejudice towards Data Science and sometimes even towards the concept of data itself (which is considered by many as a sign of the *datafication* of society, phenomenon well studied by many scholars in the recent years). Data Science is rarely seen as a discipline that provides a mature, formalized, scientific way of reasoning about data, but more often as a by-product of negative societal trends – datafication, mass surveillance, precarization and so on - that should be fought and ideally defeated. As such, the dialogue, when started, is happening either in a defensive mode (e.g. with talks where the data scientist is invited to discuss about the risks of AI for a specific field) or in an instrumental mode (where data science is used as a game, to obtain a wow effect and to entertain the audience, and that is staged by clueless “technicians”). I don’t see, apart from rare cases, situations where Data Science is invited as a peer.  

It could be interesting to focus on the history of Statistics and Data Science, how they evolved as western society evolved, how their deployment in daily activities followed changes in economic paradigm, through a plethora of conflicting incentives and interests (and I highly recommend this study to every colleague). This perspective helps me to understand some part of the negative prejudice I mentioned before, but it could provide the whole answer only if for a moment I considered Data Science as something separated from society and from the non-tech communities, something that had its historical development as autonomous entity. Something that *acted upon society*, ultimately ruining it, or making it worse (depending on the flavor of the prejudice). But Data Science is, as I tried to explain – and as its history actually proves – a formalized, mathematized reflection of the world as we experience it. Treating it as an imposed necessary evil is then, from my point of view, a limited position. 

I am also skeptical about the instrumental mode of dialogue: using Data Science (especially in its more recent manifestations that go into the domain of “Generative AI”, more precisely describable as generative deep learning) as a sideshow in events of various sorts, with the intention of mocking its limitations or generating fears, or a combination of both. 

These two dialogue modes are reducing the discussion to a very limited spectrum of possibilities, dominated by suspect, fear, or the need of “making something out” of Data Science. But if the intention is to understand better each other and work together for good causes, then I think something is still missing. 

Despite these issues I am experiencing, I still believe that promoting a dialogue between Data Science and every sphere of our complex society is much needed today. I am still optimistic also thanks to the positive examples of meaningful dialogue I had so far that, despite being the minority, give me hope. All of this will hopefully promote a more nuanced and reasonable perspective of Data Science and more interesting ways of interacting with it, that can go beyond fear, suspect or utilitarian interest. Somehow, maybe, even looking at Data Science as though we were looking at a (mathematical) mirror, to understand better ourselves.
