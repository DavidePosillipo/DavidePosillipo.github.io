      alt: data
    description: The creation, extraction and usage of quantitative information (aka data) is more and more central in our society and it is also one of my main interests. I believe in the natural progression data engineering -> statistics -> machine learning -> deep learning, in terms of topics a practictioner should know, and ideally practically master. In actuality, what I see is an increase of hype around deep learning (misleadingly commercialized as AI) and a decrease of competences and awareness about the origins of data, despite the old and well known saying "garbage in garbage out".
  - title: Social and ethical implications of data technologies

      alt: ethics
    description: Data, thought as quantitative information extracted somehow somewhere, is often imagined as a raw, "given", material, that can be used as any other resource. I believe instead that any usage of data comes with implications that are both philosophical and sociological, which should be known and addressed.
  - title: Music, bass guitar, jazz

      alt: music
    description: Music is a source of resonance with the world around us, and a source of knowledge about ourselves. For me it mainly took the shape of an electric bass guitar and of jazz, which I am actively studying and engaging with. 
  - title: Design-driven innovation

      alt: design
    description: I find the design approach to innovation and creativity really fascinating and effective, especially in business environments where I had the chance to try it, but I am sure it can go well beyond that. I am particularly interested in design thinking, and lately I have been reading more about service design and its comprehensive approach to innovation.
